Searching-for-Habitable-Exoplanet-Beyond-our-Solar-System
In this Project we have used TESS satellite data and with the help of this TESS data We are trying to find out the specific celestial body like habitable exoplanet with minimal labor efforts and maximum accuracy through using ML on data collected by space telescope/satellites. we want to see if we could look at the available exoplanet data and make predictions about which planets might be hospitable to life. The data made publicly available by NASA is beautiful in that it contains many useful features. The goal is to create a model that can predict the existence of an Exoplanet, utilizing the flux (light intensity) readings from 3198 different stars over time.
